# LLM-Powered-Project-Site-Builder-Dashboard
A modern web application that leverages LLMs to help users create, manage, and maintain multiple web or app projects from a unified dashboard. Users can input high-level build ideas, which the system transforms into fully generated site pages, forms, funnels, and boilerplate code, all stored in Firestore or Google Drive.
